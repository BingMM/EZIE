Introducing CHAOS did not seem to do anything dramatic.

The spline L-curve works great, but requires a smooth curve.

**Action points**:
- Include ground mags
- Supermag comparison
- Resolution
- Confidence region
- Sat A,B,C, what to do?
- Expand width of grid
	- Swap grid resolution in xi/eta?
- Cleaning
- Documentation

### Resolution
I can't get the resolution module to work.
I can't get the resolution to work in general.
Something odd is going on.

### Altitude
I think the altitude profiles in Franks data run from 0-120 km.

The prior profile changes over time, but very little between each subsequent measurement.
The retrieved temperature profiles changes a lot.
Between 50-90 km, where dT is high the intermeasurement difference is often around 4 degrees.

Measurement integration time is 2 seconds. With a spacecraft speed of 7.5 km/s the centroid moves 15 km. The FOV at 80 km is around 25 km in radius. Two subsequent measurements overlap by around 72%. We see temperature changes of up to 4 degrees.

Talked to Claude, see below

The altitude of the minimum temp changes with latitude.
Should this altitude be used instead of simply 80 km?
Something strange happens below ~57.5 lat. 
Not strange, but a new peak dominates.

###### Claude:
Yes, that's quite strange! With 72% spatial overlap and only 2 seconds between measurements, ±4 K temperature changes are surprisingly large.

Consider what could realistically change in 2 seconds:

- **Atmospheric dynamics**: Even fast gravity waves in the mesosphere have periods of ~5-10 minutes minimum. In 2 seconds, temperature changes from waves would be < 0.1 K
- **Spatial gradients**: With 72% overlap, you're mostly looking at the same air mass. Even strong horizontal temperature gradients in the mesosphere (say 1 K per 10 km) would only give you ~0.5-1 K difference for the 28% non-overlapping area
- **Tides/planetary waves**: These have even longer timescales (hours to days)

The ±4 K variations you're seeing are too large to be real atmospheric changes given:

1. The short 2-second time difference
2. The large 72% spatial overlap
3. The fact that the mesosphere doesn't have temperature structures that vary this rapidly

This suggests the temperature variations are likely **retrieval artifacts** rather than real atmospheric changes. Possible causes:

- **Retrieval instability**: The temperature profile retrieval might be poorly constrained at these altitudes
- **Noise fitting**: The retrieval might be fitting measurement noise as temperature variations
- **Correlation with magnetic field**: Since you're retrieving both temperature and magnetic field, there might be cross-talk between the parameters
- **A priori constraints**: Weak constraints might allow unphysical temperature jumps between retrievals

You should probably investigate whether your retrieval is well-constrained at 50-90 km altitude, or if the temperature is oscillating to compensate for other parameters in the fit.
