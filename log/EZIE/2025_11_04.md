### SuperMAG comparison

#### Bug
The SuperMAG API didn't work.
The code tried to use an SSL certificate.
It was deprecated in Python 3.12.

#### Validation class
Added *Validation* class that grabs data from the SuperMAG API etc.
The Validation class is created and called in the *Plotter* class.

#### Example
Here is an example of Franks 15th orbit:

### Temperature profiles

Setting the observation height to 80 km cannot be correct.

Using the height of the minimum temperature of the retrieved temperature profile cannot be correct either.

The temperature profile must act as a weighting function. Obviously, there are many other factors.

Using the temperature as a weight while averaging the height between 60-95 km results in a fairly steady altitude of 80-82 km.

**Classes**:
*Model*
*Data*
*MEM*
*RegularizationOptimizer*
*Plotter*
*Evaluator*
*Validation*
