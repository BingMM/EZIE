**Action points**:
- Include ground mags
	- Make new data class
- Confidence region
	- Later, if needed
- Sat A,B,C, what to do?
	- Wait for examples of any kind
- Cleaning
- Documentation

#### L-curve
I just cant get knee estimation to be stable.

Using Kneedle requires determining the location of the main convex decreasing curve.

Using Splines can introduce boundary effects that completely fuck up the first and second derivatives.
Constraining the spline fixes the boundary issue, but moves the knee.

#### Validation
Need to add safety for when there are not mags
